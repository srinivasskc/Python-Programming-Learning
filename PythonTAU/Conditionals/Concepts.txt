----------------------
If
Elif
Else

If is required to start a conditional block
You should use else whenever you want to catch any conditions not identified in "if" or "elif" statements. It can be used only once per conditional block

order matter in a conditional block
when a condition inside of the conditional block - The code exits the conditional block
python "reads" the program from top to bottom, and will cause errors if functions are called before they are created

Operators:
add +
sub -
multiply *
division /
modulus %
