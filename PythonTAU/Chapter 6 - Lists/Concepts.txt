A Python list is a collection of items.

The items in a Python list can be of any data type and the items contained in a list can even be other lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, or any mixture of Python data.
Lists are mutable, which means that the item inside of a list can be retrieved, changed, rearranged, and acted upon in multiple different ways.
Python lists maintain their order, which means that you can access something by its position or index using some of the list methods available in Python.
