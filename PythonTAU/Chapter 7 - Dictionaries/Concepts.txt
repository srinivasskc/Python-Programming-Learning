Dictionaries
Dictionaries are a type of Python data collection that stores the data in key/value pairs.

The keys are generally made of Strings, integers, or tuples, and need to be both unique and immutable.

The values can be set to any data type and any number of key/value pairs can be contained in a dictionary.

You can make an empty dictionary by assigning a dictionary name with nothing in the curly braces or your dictionary can contain millions of entries.

As of Python 3.7, the order of a dictionary can be maintained.

Dictionaries are mutable and can be changed using the Python dictionary methods.
