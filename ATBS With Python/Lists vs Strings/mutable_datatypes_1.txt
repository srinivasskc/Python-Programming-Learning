When we assign a list to a variable, 
we are actually assigning a list reference to the variable.
This applies to Mutable data types.


>>> spam = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
>>> spam
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> cheese = spam
>>> cheese
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> cheese[2] = "Hello"
>>> cheese
[0, 1, 'Hello', 3, 4, 5]
>>> spam
[0, 1, 'Hello', 3, 4, 5]
>>> 

Immutable values dont have this problem, because they cant be modified "in place"
They can only be replaced by new values.
Example: Strings
